Are the existing techniques used for detecting credit card frauds correctly and accurately providing efficient results or can it be improved using Machine Learning? +Thus, this project tries to predict credit-card frauds using Machine Learning as it is believed to provide better results as compared to the existing techniques used to detect these frauds. 

Retrieving Dataset (Kaggle): 
transactions are represented by vectors of continuous, categorical and binary features that characterize the card-holder, the transaction and the terminal. The card-holder is characterized by a unique card-holder ID, its age, its gender, etc. The transaction is characterized by variables like the date-time, the amount and other confidential features. The terminal is characterized by a unique terminal-ID, a country.

Scaling and Distributing: Scaled amount and scaled time are the columns with scaled values

Under Sampling :  consists of removing data in order to have a more balanced dataset and thus
 avoiding our models to overfitting.
